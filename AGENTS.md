# sales-generator — Agent Map

A **Willow BDR operating prototype**: Next.js app plus governance corpus that syncs HubSpot CRM notes
(why-good, opener, right contact), drafts multi-channel LinkedIn + email sequences with human approve,
and keeps Sales Nav CSV as fallback — so cold calling stays minimal.

**Geography locked:** Belgium & the Netherlands first (most Willow clients).

**This file is the entry point for coding agents.** Start here, then follow the pointers.

## Start here

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — product domains × architectural layers.
- **[docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md)** — Floor requirements (HubSpot hero, sequences, draft→approve).
- **Runtime contracts** — [docs/RULES.md](docs/RULES.md), [docs/TASKS.md](docs/TASKS.md), [docs/GOVERNANCE.md](docs/GOVERNANCE.md).

## Quality · governance · interface

- [docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md](docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md)
- [tests/evals.json](tests/evals.json) — valid / invalid cases (HubSpot + sequences included).

## Working here

- **HubSpot:** `src/lib/hubspot.ts`, `src/lib/hubspot-config.ts`, `src/app/api/hubspot/route.ts`
- **Sequences:** `src/lib/sequence-engine.ts`, `src/app/api/sequences/route.ts`, `src/components/sequence-builder-panel.tsx`
- **ICP:** `src/lib/icp.ts` (decision makers, verticals, social presence)
- **Fallback CSV:** `src/lib/sales-nav-import.ts`
- Before ship: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:evals`, `npm run test:import`, `npm run test:hubspot`.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
